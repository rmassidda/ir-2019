# Information Retrieval

Master degree in Computer Science, Universit√† di Pisa.
Notes of the Information Retrieval course taught by prof. [Ferragina](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ferragina/).

The markdown files are thought to be converted via [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

```sh
cat *.md | pandoc -o ir.pdf
```

An updated PDF copy of the notes is automatically generated as an artifact in the [actions](https://github.com/rmassidda/ir-2019/actions) tab.
A not-surely-updated PDF copy is by the way included in the repository as `ir-2019.pdf`.
